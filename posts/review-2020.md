The infamous pandemic year is gone. I don't know if it could've been better,
but I do know that I did my best.

Future self, buckle up.

## Travel

No virus is stopping me from traveling, with care I still go out there.

### Argentina March 2020

I went back to Argentina, visited family and friends, but most importantly, eating pizza and ice-cream.
I went from the north of CABA to La Plata.

After more than 20 countries, I still think the best pizza and ice-cream are
from Argentina.

The best ice cream is specifically located in the city I grew up in La Plata.
Vipentto or Thionis, I hope they never go bankrupt.

## Zaandvoort, Netherlands
