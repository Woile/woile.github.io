Hello there!

For some time I've been helping people to get into coding, and I thought about
opening up to more people here.

Learning to code is no easy task, it takes time and dedication, but thanks to
the internet is quite accesible and doable. I don't think any other profession
gets even close to the amount of material available. But I've observed, that many times,
people learning, just need to glue some ideas. That's where I can come in and help.

If you are learning programming or would like to know how/where to start,
or have questions feel free to contact me over email or twitter.

We can schedule a call or you can send me a list of questions if you have already begun your journey.

I'm offering mentoring-for-free for the time being, be kind is my requirement.

## Roadmap

I think if your programming knowledge is zero, the best way to start is by
doing **frontend** work. This means, creating websites or web applications.

Here's my initial recommendation.

1. [How the internet works][internet_works]
2. [Wrapping your mind around basic programming concepts with Hedycode.com][hedy]
3. [Responsive web design][web_design]
4. [JavaScript algorithms][javascript]

You can continue by following the [frontend roadmap][frontend_roadmap].

Contact me if you need help or you are unsure about something.

Good luck in your journey!

Santi
